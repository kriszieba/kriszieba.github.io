I'm a data scientist/engineer at [Kantega AS](kantega.no). Previously I worked as a researcher, research software developer, and worked with commercialization of research. I have background in geology and numerical modelling (MSc and PhD). I like building stuff and solving real-world problems with data and code. In my free time I bike ski or run in the mountains.
